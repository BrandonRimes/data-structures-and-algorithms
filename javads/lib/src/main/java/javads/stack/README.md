## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

### Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

### Stack

- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
- The class should contain the following methods:
  - **push**
  Arguments: value
  adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
  - **pop**
  Arguments: none
  Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack.
  Removes the node from the top of the stack.
  Should raise exception when called on empty stack.
  - **peek**
  Arguments: none
  Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack.
  Should raise exception when called on empty stack.
  - **is empty**
  Arguments: none
  Returns: Boolean indicating if the stack is empty.
